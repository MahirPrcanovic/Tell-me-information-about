Notice 1.: Only English words !

Notice 2: If you look through js and html code you might notice that i could've made sections where are classes in html meaning-1 meaning-2 meaning-3 and meaning-4(in js functions fillingData1 to fillingData4) a lot easier with only adding them up in js code with .innerHTML(If you dont know what i mean, i made 4 exactly same sections (meaning-1 to meaning-4 in html + js) making my life a lot harder and breaking DRY rule)

Unfortunately when i realised this,I was too deep in already to go back and fix it and i just left it how it is.One more lesson for me !
